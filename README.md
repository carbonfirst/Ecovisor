# Ecovisor

## Functionality to run Ecovisor in local or cluster modes

In local mode, applications are managed as containers within your computer or server.
In the cluster mode, the Ecovisor can manage a cluster of LXD servers.

### Setup

To run this, you should have LXD installed.
If not, follow the instructions below:
```
snap install lxd
lxd init
```

For more information about setting up LXD, please visit https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/latest/installing/

Once you have LXD set, install the following dependencies with pip:

```
pip install rpyc pylxd
```

Now you would need to create and add a certificate to properly authenticate the Ecovisor with LXD.
These are usually two ways to get certificates to access LXDâ€™s API. The easiest is to use the one already created with LXD:

1. Become admin (e.g., sudo su, or su)
2. Copy the two certificate and key files into your directory:
```
cp /var/snap/lxd/{server.crt,server.key} .
```

If this returns an error, try one of the following:
```
cp /var/lib/lxd/{server.crt,server.key} .
cp /var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/{server.crt,server.key} .
```

A second way, is to generate and sign the certificates yourself, and then add them into LXD to grant users owning such certificate with access. To do so, follow these commands:

1. ```lxc config set core.https_address [::]:8443```
2. ```lxc config set core.https_allowed_origin "*"```
3. ```lxc config set core.https_allowed_methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"```
4. ```lxc config set core.https_allowed_headers "Content-Type"```
5. This is just to keep the files related to authentication in a separate directory:
```mkdir lxd-api-access-cert-key-files; cd lxd-api-access-cert-key-files```
6. This generates a private key for you:
```openssl genrsa -out lxd.key 4096```
7. This creates a certificate signing request, to be signed with the key you created in Step 6:
```openssl req -new -key lxd.key -out lxd.csr```
8. This finally self-signs and create an expiration date for the certificate:
```openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in lxd.csr -signkey lxd.key -out lxd.crt```
9. This adds the certificate you just created into the LXD cluster, granting access to the cluster to whoever uses it (i.e., the Ecovisor):
```lxc config trust add lxd.crt```

Once you have the path to certificate and key, you are ready to run Ecovisor.

### Run

1. First run Carbon Manager using:
```
python3 CarbonManager.py --rm-endpoint `localhost` --lxd-cert <path to lxd certificate in single quotes> --lxd-key <path to lxd key in single quotes>
```

2. Now run ApplicationController as following:
```
python3 ApplicationController.py
```

### Customizing Application json

If you are running energy-hypervisor in a container, then it can use HPC_APPLICATION image available on the container. This is mentioned in application.json under "image". If you are running locally, we are providing a default ubuntu image in application json (as "server") and protocol (as "protocol") to initiate a container. If you want to replace any of this with your own image, you can do so by using any of the following keys in application.json:
1. Custom image can be provided under "image" keys.
2. A different image from server can be pulled using "server" and "protocol" keys.
